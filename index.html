					<p>
					At a Boston College football game in the fall of 2008, with
					a crisp autumnal breeze blowing across the Heights, Erika
					and Andrew first bumped into each other. The meeting was to
					be brief, however, as the future couple was interrupted by
					Andrew’s college roommate and occasional cousin, Nathan
					Keegan, who instantly knew the couple was meant to be. Ten
					months later, a more mature Andrew finally asked Erika on a
					date to the New England Aquarium.
					</p>

					<p>
					Thanks to Erika’s sensible friend Annie Muscarella and few
					outstanding Illinois moving violations, she said yes to the
					date. The relationship prospered from there, as true and
					distinctive as the bark of the captive New England harbor
					seal, and after a summer back home Erika decided to return
					to Boston for good. Or so Andrew thought.
					</p>

					<p>
					After four years of adventuring around the greater Boston
					area, Chicago came calling for Erika. And although Andrew
					dearly loved living in his parents’ basement, he longed for
					a reunion in the Windy City. So, a short three years later,
					Andrew and Erika are reuniting in Chicago, happy to finally
					be back together again.
